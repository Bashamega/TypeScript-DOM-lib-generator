// Keeping EventListener and EventListenerObject isn't the most elegant way to handle the event listeners, but we need to keep the EventListener as an extendable interface for libraries like angular.
interface EventListener noInterfaceObject=#true {
    method callable {
        type void
        param evt type=Event
    }
}
